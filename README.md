# link_prediction
* This project is done to predict whether edges exist among users in a network (_Twitter Social Netwrok_).
* It uses training data set to learn the model and then do the prediction over test dataset.
* The training dataset is having **4,867,136** unique nodes(_users_) and **24,004,361** edges.
* The solution uses word embeddings in capturing nodes and topologyical information of the graph in a lower dimensional space.
* And using random walk algorithm the design solutoin is very scalable.
* Over the development dataset it has achieved **0.90683** AUC score.
# Use below comamnd to run 
* Make sure to correctly put the path of dataset in the _main.py_ file.
